During the last few days we have been working on a new interface to generate
Bitcoin transactions. We wanted to support all standard types transactions 
(pay to pubkeyhash, pay to pubkey, pay to script and multisig)  while providing 
an easy to use API. This is how we arrived at the 
[Builder Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) 
and *TransactionBuilder* was born.


Hopefully *TransactionBuilder* will help Javascript developers to unleash the 
power of Bitcoin.


## Bitcoin Transactions Introduction
All Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. The inputs are the sources of the coins the transactions is spending (i.e. transfering to the outputs). The sum of all inputs' values  must be equal or greater than the sum of all outputs' values. The difference, if existent, is the fee assigned by the transaction creator to the miner. This fee will be collected by miner that includes the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Once the transaction is accepted on the network, the outputs are ready to become
inputs for future transactions. Unsurprisingly, each output can only be spent once, 
therefore a common name for the available outputs to became inputs is *unspent outputs*.

In order to spend an *unspent output* in a transaction, proof of ownership must be 
provided. Bitcoin implements this security mechanisim by adding a script to all 
outputs (called ScriptPubKey). This script must fulfilled to spend the associated 
output coins. Each time an unpent output has been spent in a transaction input, 
the input **must** provide the right arguments to the unspent's script (those 
arguments are a script theirself, which is called ScriptSig).  Failure to do 
this, will cause the rejection of the transaction by the network. ScriptPubKey 
and ScriptSig can be thought as a lock and a key, respectively.

## Standard Transactions

In Bitcoin standard transactions elliptic curve cryptography is used in 
ScriptPubKey and ScriptSig. The two more common ScriptPubKey types
 (*PayToPubKey* and *PayToPubKeyHash*) provide a public key (or its hash) 
in their contents. In order to spend the output, ScriptSig must provide 
a signature of the spending transaction using the correspoding private key.
The beauty of this mechanisim is that the private key is never revealed. 
Output's ScriptPubKey has only the public key (or its hash) and 
Input's ScriptSig has only a signature of the transaction and still 
the ownership verification can be accomplish by a third party
(the bitcoin network in our case). Usually, public keys hashed in
Bitcoin are represented as *addresses*, using a custom 
[Base58check encoding](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding).

Besides PayToPubKey and PayToPubKeyHash, Bitcoin defines to more standard
transactions: *Multisig* and *PayToScriptHash*. Multisig is similar to the 
described schema, but generalize it by providing multiple (N) public keys 
on ScriptPubKey and asking for certain number (M) of signatures to allow 
spending the output. Examples of Multisig configurations are 2 required 
signatures out of 3 given public keys, 3 out of 5, and 2 out of 2. 
 Use cases for Multisig include shared control of coins, 2 factor 
authentication, third party arbitration, etc.

Finally, in PayToScriptHash (or P2SH) ScriptPubKey just contain a 
hash of a script. In order to spend the transaction, the corresponding
 script must be provided on the input (on ScriptSig), AND that script
 must be fullfil with the signatures also included on ScriptSig.

### TransactionBuilder

Without further do, here are some examples of using the new interface
for creating transactions:

Transaction generation and signing
``` js
  var bitcore = require('bitcore'); // for browser, check Readme and 
                                    // example/example.html examples.
  var Builder = bitcore.TransactionBuilder;
  var tx = new Builder(opts)
    .setUnspent(utxos)
    .setOutputs(outs)
    .sign(keys)
    .build();

  // Transaction ready for broadcast.
  broadcast(tx.serialize().toString('hex'));
```
In the example, `utxos` are the available unspent outputs for the 
transactions. The list of unspent output for a bitcoin address can 
be obtained from Bitcoin blockchain APIs, like [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info), 
[biteasy.com](http://biteasy.com), [blockr.io](http://blockr.io), or our 
own open-sourced [insigh-api](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api). 

The expected format for the unspent outputs is:
```
[
    {
      "address": "2Mwswt6Eih28xH8611fexpqKqJCLJMomveK",
      "scriptPubKey": "a91432d272ce8a9b482b363408a0b1dd28123d59c63387",
      "txid": "2ac165fa7a3a2b535d106a0041c7568d03b531e58aeccdd3199d7289ab12cfc1",
      "vout": 1,
      "amount": 1.0,
      "confirmations":7
    }
    , { ... }
]
```

The *outs* defines the outputs of the transaction. Depending on the transaction type, different
elements must be provided. For a standart PayToPubKeyHash, the format is:
```
  var outs = [{
    address:infoForP2sh.address, 
    amount:0.05,
  }, {...}];

```
For other types, see examples below.


Once the output is defined, *TransactionBuilder* will scan the `unspent outputs` 
to select the ones needed to fulfill the transaction output amount. Following the 
reference client implementation criteria, *TransactionBuilder* will look first for
unspent outputs with 6 or more 
confirmations, then outputs with 1 or more confirmations will be selected and
 finally (and only if option `spendUnconfirmed: true` was provided at `opts`) 
outputs with 0 confirmations will be selected. Unless a fixed `fee` was included
in `opts`, the fee will be dynamically calculated depending the transaction size, 
using [bitcoin guidelines](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees).

Once the inputs, outputs and the fee are defined, *TransactionBuilder* will add 
an output to collect the remainder amount, if any, in a remainder out. This out
 can be provided in `opts` (see examples below), or the first input will be 
automatically selected.

Other options include: `lockTime` to set transaction's `lock_time`; `signhash` 
to set the signature types, which defaults to *Transaction.SIGHASH_ALL*.


It is expected that the set of private `keys` will the match the output's 
ScriptPubKey to unlock them. After `.sign(keys)` is called, `.isFullySigned()` 
can be call to check if all inputs are properly signed. This schema work with all 
stardart type of transactions including Multisig as demostrated later.


Transaction generation and later signing

``` js
  var b = new Builder(opts)
    .setUnspent(utxos)
    .setOutputs(outs);

  var incompleteTx  = b.build();

  while(!b.isFullySigned()) {
    var keys = getMoreKeys();
    b.sign(keys);
  };
  var completeTx  = b.build();
  broadcast(tx.serialize().toString('hex'));

```

To generate P2SH transactions, the utility `.infoForP2sh` is provided. This
static method can help the creator to obtains a p2sh address for multisignature
transactions, and also can generate the redeem script hash.



P2SH Transaction generation and later signing

``` js

  var infoForP2sh   = Builder.infoForP2sh({
    nreq    :3, 
    pubkeys:pubkeys, 
    amount  :0.05,
  }, 'testnet');
 
  var outs = [{
    address:infoForP2sh.address, 
    amount:0.05,
  }];

  var map = {};
  map[p2shAddress]=infoForP2sh;

  var info = Builder.  
  var b = new Builder(opts)
    .setUnspent(utxos)
    .setHashToScriptMap(map)
    .setOutputs(outs);

  var incompleteTx  = b.build();

  while(!b.isFullySigned()) {
    var keys = getMoreKeys();
    b.sign(keys);
  };
  var completeTx  = b.build();
  broadcast(tx.serialize().toString('hex'));

```

Sending remainder to a defined output.
``` js
  var opts = {
    remainderOut: {address: 'mwZabyZXg8JzUtFX1pkGygsMJjnuqiNhgd'},
  };
  var tx = new Builder(opts)
    .setUnspent(utxos)
    .setOutputs(outs)
    .sign(keys)
    .build();
```
